-> whoami: This one allows you to be able to tell the users of the computer, if its in default, it returns the computer name and if otherwise it returns the username.

-> uname: This is like asking the computer to prints it name, basically this works well by asking the computer what is OS is running on the computer.

-> ~: This is used to depict a home directory.
